Description: The method zGPS.AO (Zero Inflated Gamma Poisson Shrinker with AE ontology) is based on the zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. It estimates the association between a specific vaccine and an adverse event group, as well as associations between that vaccine and individual adverse events within the adverse event group. This model handles the adverse event count data with excess zeros and over-dispersion, and it allows borrowing information from adverse event data in the same group. Details can be found in "Data Mining in Large Frequency Tables With Ontology, with an Application to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System" Bangyao Zhao, Lili Zhao (2020) <arXiv:2010.12471>.
