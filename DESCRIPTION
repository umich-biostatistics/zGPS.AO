Description: The method zGPS.AO (Zero Inflated Gamma Poisson Shrinker withAE ontology) 
is based on the zero inflated negative binomial distribution. 
This model has two purples:a regression model obtain group level estimation, 
and a empirical bayes framework to evaluate AElevel risks. In this package, 
we wrap up our method into an all-in-one function with detailed documentation for researchers to use. 
To speed up, this function has a built-in parallelization feature to utilize multi-core modern computers. 
We also have developed some functions to visualize the results.
